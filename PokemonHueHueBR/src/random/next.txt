protected int next(int bits)

    Generates the next pseudorandom number. Subclasses should override this,
as this is used by all other methods.

    The general contract of next is that it returns an int value and if the
argument bits is between 1 and 32 (inclusive), then that many low-order bits of
the returned value will be (approximately) independently chosen bit values,
each of which is (approximately) equally likely to be 0 or 1. The method next
is implemented by class Random by atomically updating the seed to

(seed * 0x5DEECE66DL + 0xBL) & ((1L << 48) - 1)

and returning

(int)(seed >>> (48 - bits)).

    This is a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator, as defined by
D. H. Lehmer and described by Donald E. Knuth in The Art of Computer 
Programming, Volume 3: Seminumerical Algorithms, section 3.2.1.

Parameters:
bits - random bits

Returns:
the next pseudorandom value from this random number generator's sequence
