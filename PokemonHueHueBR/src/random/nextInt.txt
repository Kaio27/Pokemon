public int nextInt()

    Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value from this 
random number generator's sequence. The general contract of nextInt is that one 
int value is pseudorandomly generated and returned. All 232 possible int values 
are produced with (approximately) equal probability.

The method nextInt is implemented by class Random as if by:

 public int nextInt() {
   return next(32);
 }

Returns:
the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value from this random 
number generator's sequence
